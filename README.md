A local website that allows you to track investments for Hypixel Skyblock. You can register an account to manage your own personal portfolio. Items can be added to the portfolio at a custom purchase price, and the profit will be calculated automatically through the Hypixel API. Portfolios are stored in a local MongoDB database.

The website was made using React with a NodeJS API for authentication, storing data to the database, and getting Hypixel API data.
